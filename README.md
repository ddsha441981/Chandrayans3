Step 2: Open your favorite IDE for the backend (STS, IntelliJ IDEA) and for the frontend (VS Code, WebStorm).
Step 3: We'll set up the backend project first. Open your IDE and either clone the project or open the cloned folder.
Step 4: Before starting the backend, there are some configurations needed, such as adding your SonarQube token in the pom.xml file. First, download SonarQube from this link. After downloading, we need to have OpenJDK 17 installed to run SonarQube.

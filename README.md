Step 2: Open your favorite IDE for the backend (STS, IntelliJ IDEA) and for the frontend (VS Code, WebStorm).

Step 3: We'll set up the backend project first. Open your IDE and either clone the project or open the cloned folder.

Step 4: Before starting the backend, there are some configurations needed, such as adding your SonarQube token in the pom.xml file. First, download SonarQube from [Download SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/downloads/historical-downloads/). After downloading, we need to have [OpenJDK 17 Download]([https://jdk.java.net/17/](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/archive/?version=17)) installed to run SonarQube.
